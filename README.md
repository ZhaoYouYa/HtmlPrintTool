## What is it?

It's a simple tool that helps front-end developers print a webpage by an HTTP request or a message from a connected WebSocket.

A usual occasion is we write web code to solve our problem, but it can't call OS API. for example, how to print something when a message from service is achieved automatically?

It's written by C++/Qt. Qt is a cross-platform framework, but I test it only on windows.

## How to use it?

You need to install an EXE on your local computer
I don't achieve it.
