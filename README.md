## What is it?

It's a simple tool that helps front-end developers print a webpage by an HTTP request or a message from a connected WebSocket.
A usual occasion is we write web running on a browser, but it has problems at call OS API. for example, how to print something automatically when a message from service is achieved?
It's written by C++/Qt. Qt is a cross-platform framework, but I test it only on windows.
